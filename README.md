For ethical bug bounty research only! Give it a domain and let it run! Enumerates subdomains with Amass, screenshots all subdomains with EyeWitness (with option to proxy through Burp or Zap by modifying script), Runs Nmap and Nikto scans on enumerated subdomains, and outputs results to folders for manual review and target selection.
